Zeolite map in JavaScript to visualize the data from the 2023 Digital Discovery paper
# IZA Distance Matrix Visualization

This repository contains an interactive visualization of the IZA (International Zeolite Association) Distance Matrix, showing relationships between zeolite frameworks.

## Description

The visualization represents zeolite frameworks as nodes, with links connecting similar frameworks. The similarity is truncated to show only the selected number of nearest neighbors. This tool allows users to explore the structural relationships between different zeolite frameworks interactively.

## How to Use

1. Visit the [GitHub Pages site](https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name) to view the visualization.
2. Adjust the number of nearest neighbors using the slider on the left sidebar.
3. Search for specific frameworks by entering labels in the search box.
4. Find the shortest path between two frameworks by entering their labels in the path search box.
5. Use the "Replot Graph" button to rearrange the layout.
6. Zoom and pan the visualization using your mouse or touchpad.
